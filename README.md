# [Community Dev Containers](https://github.com/devcontainers-contrib) Charter

The [Community Dev Containers](https://github.com/devcontainers-contrib) project
is just a fun little side project 🤷 that I'm keeping up to document, maintain,
and maybe even improve the official devcontainers images, features, and
templates.

This project is just for kicks, so let's keep things lighthearted 🎉. I don't
have a lot of time to invest in this, so things might take a while to get done.
And, I'm not looking to add any collaborators at this time 🙅‍♂️.

The official [@devcontainers](https://github.com/devcontainers) project only
covers the basics, but there might be other features, images, and templates that
folks would like to see. That's where this project comes in!

I'll be maintaining and evolving the images, features, templates, and
documentation content for all the cool stuff that's not covered by the official
[@devcontainers](https://github.com/devcontainers) organization. I'll try to
listen to feedback, but there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get to
everything right away 🤷‍♂️.
